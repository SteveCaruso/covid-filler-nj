## A JavaScript Autofill Injection Bookmarklet For CoVID Vaccine Signups

### What is CoVID Injection?

A small bookmarklet that holds a JavaScript "injection" which helps volunteers who are signing folks up for CoVID vaccines enter user information into a number of forms faster than they could do so by hand. It works in conjunction with a spreadsheet signup form.

Presently, it is only designed to work with the New Jersey CoVID elligibility restrictions, but it should work with other States as well.

### How Can I Use It?

Visit the [website](https://covid-injection.netlify.app/) and you'll find instructions and the bookmarklet generator there.

### Spreadsheet Description

When you copy a row of the Google or Excel Spreadsheet, it reads the data into the clipboard as a TSV (Tab Seperated Value) list â€“ i.e. each value is separated by a tab.

Using the [custom bookmarklet generator](https://covid-injection.netlify.app/custom.html), you can create a bookmarklet that can recognize those values and will autofill from your own spreadsheet (with some restrictions).
